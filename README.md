## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
In this project, I learned how to effectively use CSS to style hover states for interactive elements. Specifically, I learned how to change the color of text inside an anchor tag when its parent list item is hovered. This enhances the user experience by providing visual feedback on interactive elements.

### Continued development
Moving forward, I want to continue improving my skills in responsive design and accessibility. Ensuring that my projects are usable and accessible to all users, regardless of their device or abilities, is a priority for me. I also plan to explore more advanced CSS techniques and JavaScript to add more interactivity to my projects.
